AESTHETIC EXPLAINATION:

During WW2 the Japanese government restricted magazines, newspapers ads and various other things to using only black and red ink(in addition to the white of the page) due to resource scarsity during the war. I personally love the aesthetic this created and have wanted to work with it for a long time.

In autumn, bugs are really important in Japan. The sound of cicadas is very culturally significant, nobles would sit and listen to those sounds similar to how they would have cherry blossom veiwings in the spring. both of these are still done today.

It is a long standing tradition(granted not a very serious one) in Japan for children to catch stag beetles or rhinoserous beetles in autumn and keep them as pets. (and cock fight with them but whatever)

This game is about a Japanese child catching stag beetles in autumn despite the war. I know I'm so deep.
